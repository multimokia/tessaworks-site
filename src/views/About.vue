    <h2 class="self-start text-3xl font-bold">Origins</h2>
    <p>
      Tessa was born with a degenerative disease. One that was slowly consuming her body. Her parents were some of the
      best anyone could've asked for. They tried everything they could for her. Getting her the best doctors, the best
      medicine, anything and everything they could to help her. But nothing worked. Years went by of her dealing with it,
      and eventually it was basically down to her either amputating her limbs, or being fully consumed by the disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      She amputated. But thankfully for her, she was an engineering prodigy. Before the operations, she managed to make
      some crude replacement limbs that she designed and built herself, with the last of the motor control that was left.
      They were rough and scrappy, but they'd do the job.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was happy again, but noticed something in her parents changed. They had sadness in her eyes as they looked at
      her. They felt <i>sorry</i> for her...and no matter what she said, how much she told them it was okay, that she
      was fine, they couldn't let go of it.
    </p>
    <Separator/>
    <h2 class="self-start text-3xl font-bold">Reclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Because of how rough her limbs were, she was never really accepted by those she met. She was often bullied and excluded,
      among other various things that pushed her to her limits often because they simply didn't see her as human.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she began to resent people in general, and eventually her home was the one real place she found happiness...and she
      wanted to return that happiness to her parents. She spent years tweaking her limbs, designing and redesigning them
      until they were near perfect, borderline impossible to tell unless you saw the seems between her body and the limbs
      themselves, which at the very top, bear her logo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her social problem only got worse though. Despite her improvements, things got no better, and eventually she kinda
      just wanted it to stop. She started caring less and less about being human. If nobody wanted her it's their problem.
      And so she grew to be a recluse, focusing on herself instead of others.
    </p>

    <h2 class="self-start text-3xl font-bold">Space</h2>
    <p>
      Until one day, she came across a damaged space faring ship. Its crew was nearby, looking for ways to begin repairs.
      Tessa has always held a strong curiosity about the stars and wished to study them. Being a technical prodigy, she
      offered to help repair their ship -- which was met initially with scoffs and dismissal until she made quick work
      at fixing one of their engines. The crew took her seriously enough to hear her out.
    </p>
    <p>
      In exchange for fixing their ship, she would temporarily join their crew for research on astral bodies. A family
      friend who had a career in space exploration was to accompany her to ensure her safety. The crew agreed, and accepted
      them on board once they finished repairing the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out in space, the crew visited all manner of stars, nebulae, black holes, and all. Tessa took detailed notes and
      produced several hypotheses and reports she would eventually test.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she began experimenting, she learned of a way to create her own black holes and white holes through induction.
      With her and the crew still being among the stars, She eventually learned about a
      way to <i>manufacture</i> black holes through induction, and with them, split them into a black hole and a white hole.
      The likes of which can be travelled through. She kept these samples to take back home with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she arrived back home, she immediately set to work on a new project. Having given up on most of her humanity,
      she asked herself: "Why bother trying to seem human? Let's see how far we can push our boundaries..." she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      She designed a warp core that could fit in her own body, fitted with the black hole and white hole.
      Allowing her to teleport from place to place at will, using the very warp technology she developed through her
      research in space.
      <br/>
      And after months of work, it was finally complete. She built her warp core. Capable of letting her teleport things
      to her, or herself to places she knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      But by how the teleportation worked...she observed something curious. As the black hole expands around her
      to teleport her, in its event horizon, she could see the location and place around her...but from generations in the
      past, hypothetically all the way up to its initial point if she were looking under the finest lens.
    </p>
    <p><i>...And she wondered if she could traverse those ripples of time herself too.</i></p>
    <Separator/>
    <h2 class="self-start text-3xl font-bold">Time</h2>
    <p>
      She experimented an experimented, trying different catalysts to offset the position of her traversal on the temporal
      scale. She missed it the first time she tried sending raw electricity into the warp core, its effects were so small
      they could <i>almost</i> be classed as error.
      <br/>
      She tried once more, this time pushing more power in, and noticed a slightly more significant leap in time. She
      had cracked the code! Power would allow her to send things back in time...but she would need a lot of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so she contacted her previous crew, and took to space once more for another round of research.
      The warp core still in her torso. From her research, she had learned about different types of stars, this time
      she was looking for one in particular... <em class="font-bold">A pulsar</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crew heads to a system with a pulsar star, the waves of radiation strike the ship and periodically disable
      some of the systems as it acts like an EMP blast. Tessa's experiment is to send something through her warp core
      during one of these blasts and seeing if it comes out before she puts it in.
    </p>
    <p>In one hand, she holds her clipboard with notes. "Here goes everything..." she says as a ring of energy hurdles
      toward the ship. Just before she inserts it, she sees a perfect copy appear in front of her and land on the ship's
      floor. She then inserts the clipboard she holds into her warp core.
    </p>
    <p>She had successfully proven her hypothesis, and now had velocity in that space as the black hole expands.</p>
    <p>
      With her theory confirmed, she researches the pulsar more learning how they're formed, how to sustain them, and more
      importantly, how one would even begin to stabilize one.<br/>
      She works to manufacture one of her own pulsars -- significantly smaller than the one outside the ship, but one
      that would fit at the heart of her core.
    </p>
    <Separator/>
    <h2 class="self-start text-3xl font-bold">Out of Time</h2>
    <p>
      Back at home, she tries to demonstrate her ability to her parents, who find it fascinating. They both know she'll
      do amazing things...<i>if things would last that long.</i> It turns out, another force had their eyes on her for some
      time now. The military. Who wanted that technology for themselves, no matter what.
    </p>
    <p>
      And one day, sensing the readings of her tech, raided her home. They wanted to take her away, remove her tech,
      and use it for their purposes. Her parents weren't going to let that happen. They carefully snuck her out. and told
      her to run. And that she would do great things.
    </p>
    <Separator/>
    <h2 class="self-start text-3xl font-bold">Innocence Lost</h2>
    <p>
      Around 5 minutes into running, ringing out. Tessa could hear two gunshots..and her innocence finally left her.
      She knew what happened. And thus began cold. She was on the run. military still wanted her, she went into hiding
      completely on her own, only 12 years old.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her parents gave her the world, she wanted to share it with them, and sadly, her actions only got them killed.
      She resented humanity. She was taught the lesson that life itself has little meaning. Not even her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so in a last act of desperation, she pushed herself to her limits, she can't remember if it was to try and go
      back, or just to end it all, but she performed a charged warp, so strong it stopped her heart for a few beats.
      Sending her to an empty void in space.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody, nothing around....or so she thought. There was one. A void witch who resided there, she too was alone.
      But she _wanted_ to visit others, she had her eye on humanity already.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so they talked, Tessa and her resentment. The witch, Lewn, and her admiration.
      The two got close, and the witch was someone Tessa could feel empathy for. Eventually she tried to return, but found
      herself on the opposite coin of the place she's at. <i>The End of Time</i>. A bustling area filled with time anomalies
      akin to herself, from many different species, generations, and more.
    </p>
    <Separator/>
    <h2 class="self-start text-3xl font-bold">The End of Time</h2>
    <p>
      She was given her mission to seek out other anomalies who've gone rogue, or to rid the world of those who intended
      to abuse time, or could destroy spacetime, and thus reality. Most notably, these happened to be humans who tried
      to replicate her tech. She took joy in slaughtering them. Often rolling back the clock multiple times to slaughter
      them several times over for what they did. Innocent, guilty, she didn't care. She was there to destroy their
      research. Regardless of what stood between her and it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually, she would be assigned to keep track of a mage, following reports of a new region of space having been
      created out of the blue. Turns out she's very kind, and offered her a place to set up a lab and stay in that space.
      Which she uses both for her mission, but also because between the residents there, they're a bunch of found family
